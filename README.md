# **NBA Data Analysis**
(In-Progress)

## **Project Overview**


This project analyzes factors influencing NBA game attendance. The primary objective is to develop predictive models that can help the NBA make data-driven strategic decisions to optimize game scheduling, marketing efforts, and operational planning. The analysis utilizes data sourced from Kaggle and employs Python and SQL for data processing and model development.

## **Key Objectives**

- **Understand Key Drivers of Attendance:** Identify the most significant factors that influence whether a game will have above-average or sellout attendance.
- **Develop Predictive Models:** Build and evaluate logistic regression and decision tree models to predict game attendance based on various features.
- **Provide Strategic Recommendations:** Offer actionable insights to optimize NBA operations, focusing on game scheduling, marketing, and logistics.

## **Data Sources**
